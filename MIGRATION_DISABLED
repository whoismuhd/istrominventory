SMART MIGRATION PROTECTION
This file helps protect production data while allowing code changes to deploy.

Code changes WILL deploy to production.
Data changes will be PROTECTED if production has existing data.

Protected data (if production has data):
- Users created on live app
- Items added on live app  
- Requests made on live app
- Notifications created on live app
- All other changes made on live app

CODE CHANGES WILL DEPLOY, DATA CHANGES WILL BE PROTECTED
